The current copy of "Project Ruin," a top-down dungeon-crawler game developed by Team Stairways works properly. The player can pick up weapons and interact with the
environment buttons by pressing the "E" key, switch between a gun and a spear using the "1" and "2" keys, and attack enemies by pressing the right mouse button.

The player can also utilize cheat abilities in the game. The cheat we have implemented is pressing "F1" to become invincible, something that may be needed to handle
the enemies. We also made a secret room that the players need to access to win the game.

Enemies work well for the most part in the game. enemy animations could be better and some enemies will pass through walls, but these issues can be used to the 
game's advantage by providing a different experience each time a person plays. The main enemies are bats too, and bats can hide in small holes inside caves in
the real world, so phasing through walls is not too big a problem.

The main issue in the game is the animation issues found in the player's character. The animations do not trigger properly and the animation for attacking with a
spear is non-existent. Part of this issue stems from the player's character prefab being very restrictive and not allowing programmers and animators to animate it
differently from its current design without making a new avatar rig. Player animations exist, but they are not the most accurate or effective. This can make the spear
attacks jarring, but the attacks still register.

The second bug is the bullet prefab that passes through multiple enemies. This may be an intentional design, though. This bug actually helps the game by decreasing
the game's difficulty once the gun is acquired.

The third issue in the game is the lack of other sounds when the bats are hit. This was more of an oversight on the developers' part.

A fourth potential issue is the lack of lighting in some areas of the game, making some enemies invisible and leave the player open to attacks, but this is part of
the game's atmosphere and the UI mini map helps compensate.

A fifth issue, which may have been a one-time glitch, was whenever the player dies and the level must be replayed, the spear does not seem to work on the enemies. 
This may be a one-time glitch, but it is worth mentioning.

The last issue involves the the GUI and some of the text in the game. The victory scene's text is cut off partially at the top, and the GUI for the play may not be in
the best position in the game.
